## Overview

This repository includes a series of exercises to practice different asynchronous programming techniques in JavaScript. Each part of the exercises involves creating an HTML file and implementing specific JavaScript functionality.

## Tasks

### Part 1: Callbacks

**Objective:** Implement a basic HTML and CSS layout with a button and a div element. Use JavaScript callbacks to simulate a delay and fetch data from an API.

- **Task 1: HTML and CSS**
  - Create `callbacks.html` with a basic HTML structure and styling using Tailwind CSS.
  
- **Task 2: Callback Implementation**
  - Implement a callback function to simulate a 5-second delay when a button is clicked and update the text in the div.

- **Task 3: Fetch Data from API**
  - Modify the callback implementation to fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API and display post titles in the div.

### Part 2: Promises

**Objective:** Implement an HTML and CSS layout with a button and a div element. Use Promises to fetch data from an API and handle errors.

- **Task 1: HTML and CSS**
  - Create `promises.html` with a basic HTML structure and styling using Tailwind CSS.

- **Task 2: Promise Implementation**
  - Use Promises to fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API. Show "Loading..." while the Promise is pending and update the div with fetched data.

- **Task 3: Error Handling**
  - Handle errors and timeouts in the Promise implementation and display appropriate messages in the div.

### Part 3: Async/Await

**Objective:** Use `async/await` to fetch data from an API and handle errors.

- **Task 1: HTML and CSS**
  - Create `async-await.html` with a basic HTML structure and styling using Tailwind CSS.

- **Task 2: Async/Await Implementation**
  - Use `async/await` to fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API. Show "Loading..." while the data is being fetched and update the div with fetched data.

- **Task 3: Error Handling**
  - Implement error handling for network issues and timeouts using `async/await`. Display error messages in the div.

## Usage

To run these exercises, simply open the respective HTML files in a web browser. Each file demonstrates different asynchronous programming techniques.
